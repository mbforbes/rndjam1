# R&Djam1

Linear models for MNIST.

Goals:
- [ ] Setup and tooling
    - [ ] Software: pytorch and dashbaord in venv
    - [ ] Data: mnist in CSV
    - [ ] **Data split: train + val**
    - [ ] **Data viewer: normal and bloated**
    - [ ] Data normalization per pixel
    - [ ] Dashboard setup: dummy test
    - [ ] **Data saving: speed of: one big tensor in compressed format (hd5?)**
      **vs one big csv from disk**
- [ ] Linear regression
    - [ ] Matrix inversion
    - [ ] GD
    - [ ] SGD
    - [ ] L1
    - [ ] L2
    - [ ] Lp
    - [ ] Hyperparam tuning framework and **graphs**
    - [ ] **Graphs of accuracy and speed of above methods**
- [ ] One vs rest logistic regression
    - [ ] All applicable for linear regression (expand once here)
- [ ] Multinomial logistic regression
    - [ ] All applicable from linear regression (expand once here)
- [ ] **Best models on test**
- [ ] **Compare to MNIST website numbers**

Deliverables
- [ ] Goal written
- [ ] Goal checked against guidelines
- [ ] Github issues made
- [ ] All above implemented
- [ ] Report with above bolded items
- [ ] Revise report to have balance of equations, text, pictures, and graphs

Timeline:
- Due EOD Wednesday
